    <h2>Traditional Saudi dish</h2>
    <p>
      Al kabsa was the first Arabic dish I ever made. It turned out extremely
      delicious and is a new favorite. Serve with fresh mixed cucumber, carrot,
      lettuce, and tomato salad — preferably with a little lime vinaigrette.
      Some fresh pita bread on the side would also be nice. Saudis like their
      kabsa with a hot sauce called shattah. Enjoy!

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make spice mix: Stir together saffron, cinnamon, allspice, lime powder,
        cardamom, and white pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        Make dish: Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium
        heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in butter until onion has softened
        and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook over
        medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10
        minutes. Mix in tomato purée.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, carrots, cloves, nutmeg, cumin,
        coriander, salt, black pepper, and reserved spice mix. Cook for about 3
        minutes; pour in water and add chicken bouillon cube.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat, and cover the pot. Simmer until
        chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        Gently stir in rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and
        almost dry, about 25 minutes; add raisins and a little more hot water,
        if necessary. Cover and cook until rice grains separate, 5 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        Transfer rice to a large serving platter and arrange chicken on top.
        Sprinkle with toasted slivered almonds.
